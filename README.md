# Deadlock-Detection 
Developed a system to simulate deadlocks in a resource allocation scenario.
Implemented Wait-for Graph-based detection to identify deadlocks based on resource allocation.
Included a simple deadlock recovery mechanism, such as process termination, to resolve detected deadlocks.
Visualized the systemâ€™s state, including process statuses and resource allocation, to track and detect deadlocks.
Tech Stack: C, Resource Allocation Algorithms.
