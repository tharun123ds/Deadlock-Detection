# Deadlock-Detection System

A system designed to simulate and resolve deadlocks in resource allocation scenarios, using efficient algorithms to identify and recover from deadlocks. This project demonstrates strong skills in **C programming**, **modular design**, and **deadlock management algorithms**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Deadlock Simulation**: Test and analyze various deadlock scenarios.
- **Wait-for Graph Detection**: Implements a graph-based cycle detection mechanism.
- **Deadlock Recovery**: Resolves deadlocks through process termination or resource reallocation.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Organized into reusable and extendable components.
- **File-Based Configuration**: Configure processes and resources via input files.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: C
- **Concepts**: Resource Allocation, Deadlock Detection, Process Management
- **Algorithms**: Wait-for Graph Detection, Cycle Detection

## 📝 Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following installed:

### 1. **C Compiler**:
   - You need a **C compiler** to build the project. The project uses `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection).
   - Install GCC if you don't have it:
     - On **Linux** (Ubuntu/Debian):
       ```bash
       sudo apt update
       sudo apt install build-essential
       ```
     - On **macOS** (using Homebrew):
       ```bash
       brew install gcc
       ```
     - On **Windows**, you can install **MinGW** or use the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**.

### 2. **Make Utility**:
   - This project uses `make` to automate the build process. Make sure you have it installed.
   - On **Linux**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install make
     ```
   - On **macOS**:
     ```bash
     brew install make
     ```
   - On **Windows**, `make` can be installed through MinGW or WSL.

## 📜 How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tharun123ds/Deadlock-Detection.git
cd Deadlock-Detection
````

### 2. Build the project

Use `make` to compile the source code and generate the executable.

```bash
make
```

### 3. Run the program

After the project is built, you can run the program with the following command:

```bash
./deadlock_detector
```

This will execute the program and perform the resource allocation simulation. The system will detect deadlocks and print the results.

### 4. Run the tests

To run the unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
make run
```

This will execute the compiled test cases defined in `test_cases.c`, which include tests for:

- Safe state verification
- Deadlock detection
- Deadlock resolution by terminating processes

### 5. Clean the build

To clean up object files and the compiled executable, use:

```bash
make clean
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Available Tests

- **Safe State Test**: Verifies the system is in a safe state.
- **Deadlock Detection Test**: Simulates a scenario where a deadlock occurs.
- **Deadlock Resolution Test**: Verifies that deadlock is resolved by terminating processes.

Run these tests using the `make run` command after building the project.

---

## 🌟 Key Algorithms

### **Wait-for Graph Detection**

- Constructs a dynamic graph where:
  - Nodes represent processes.
  - Edges represent dependencies due to resource allocation.
- Detects cycles in the graph to identify deadlocks.

### **Deadlock Recovery**

- Terminates processes involved in the deadlock to release resources and recover the system.
